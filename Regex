1. `RegExp` Class:
   - The `RegExp` class is part of Dart's core libraries, which Flutter also uses.
   - You can create a `RegExp` object to represent a regular expression pattern.

2. Anchors:
   - `^`: The caret symbol (^) is used as the start anchor. It signifies that the pattern must match at the beginning of the string.
   - `$`: The dollar sign ($) is used as the end anchor. It signifies that the pattern must match at the end of the string.

3. Character Classes:
   - `\d`: Matches any digit (0-9).
   - `\D`: Matches any character that is not a digit.
   - `\w`: Matches any word character (alphanumeric characters and underscores).
   - `\W`: Matches any non-word character.
   - `\s`: Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.).
   - `\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character.

4. Quantifiers:
   - `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.
   - `+`: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.
   - `?`: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element.
   - `{n}`: Matches exactly `n` occurrences of the preceding element.
   - `{n,}`: Matches `n` or more occurrences of the preceding element.
   - `{n,m}`: Matches between `n` and `m` occurrences of the preceding element.

5. Special Characters:
   - `.`: Matches any character except a newline.
   - `\`: Escapes a special character, allowing you to match it as a literal character. For example, to match a period (.), you would use `\.`.

6. Grouping and Alternation:
   - `()`: Parentheses are used for grouping and capturing subpatterns.
   - `|`: The vertical bar (pipe) is used for alternation, allowing you to match one of several patterns.

Here's a simple example in Flutter that demonstrates how to create a `RegExp` object and use it to match a pattern in a string:
void main() {
  RegExp regex = RegExp(r'^\d{3}\.\d$');
  String input = '123.4';

  if (regex.hasMatch(input)) {
    print('Input matches the pattern.');
  } else {
    print('Input does not match the pattern.');
  }
}
