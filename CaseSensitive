**CamelCase:**

Summary of Flutter Dart File Naming Conventions:

Lowercase letters with underscores (snake_case).
No capital letters or special characters.
Widgets: Use descriptive names like custom_button.dart, user_card.dart.
Models: Name files after the model, e.g., user.dart, product.dart.
Screens: Use the term screen or page, e.g., home_screen.dart, login_screen.dart.
Tests: Add _test to the file name, e.g., login_screen_test.dart.
Avoid abbreviations and ensure file names are meaningful and clear.




Summary of Naming Conventions in Flutter (Dart):

   Class Name:   Person, UserProfile, CarModel (PascalCase)
Variable Name:   userName, isActive, totalAmount (camelCase)
Function Name:   calculateTotal(), fetchData() (camelCase)
  Method Name:   updateName(), getDetails() (camelCase)
   File Name :   home_screen.dart,login_screen.dart,snake_case   



In CamelCase, the first letter of the first word is lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word is capitalized.
No spaces or underscores are used between words, and each word is joined without any separator.
Example: myVariableName, calculateTotalAmount, phoneNumber.
PascalCase (or UpperCamelCase):

In PascalCase, the first letter of each word is capitalized, including the first word.
No spaces or underscores are used between words, and each word is joined without any separator.
Example: MyClassName, CalculateAreaOfRectangle, PhoneNumber.
snake_case:

In snake_case, words are written in lowercase, and underscores _ are used to separate words.
Words are joined with underscores, and there are no uppercase letters.
Example: my_variable_name, calculate_total_amount, phone_number.
