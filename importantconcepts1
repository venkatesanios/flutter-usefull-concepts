   Dart mixins allow you to reuse a class's code in multiple class hierarchies. By using the "with" keyword, you can include the functionality of a mixin class into another class, thus promoting code reuse without the need for inheritance.

88. **Explain the difference between "async" and "sync" functions in Dart, and when should you use each?**
   "async" functions are used for asynchronous operations, and they can use "await" to pause the execution until the awaited Future completes. "sync" functions are synchronous, meaning they execute in a blocking manner, without performing any asynchronous operations.

89. **What is Dart's "factory" constructor, and how does it differ from a regular constructor?**
   A "factory" constructor is used to return an instance of a class that is not necessarily the type of the class itself. It allows you to control the object creation process and return different types of instances based on specific conditions.

90. **Explain Dart's "typedef" and "Function" types, and how you can use them to define function types and callbacks.**
   "typedef" is used to define custom function types, allowing you to create aliases for specific function signatures. The "Function" type is a built-in type that represents a generic function signature, and it can be used as a callback in many scenarios.

91. **What are Dart extensions, and how do they help in adding new functionalities to existing classes?**
   Dart extensions allow you to add new functionalities to existing classes without modifying the original class's code. Extensions are especially useful when you want to add utility methods or behavior to classes from external libraries.

92. **Explain the use of Dart's "async" generators and "yield" keyword for generating streams of data asynchronously.**
   Dart's "async" generators use the "yield" keyword to emit a sequence of values as an asynchronous stream. The generator function can pause and resume execution with "yield" to provide values to the stream over time.

93. **What are Dart annotations, and how can you use them to provide metadata and code generation hints?**
   Dart annotations are used to provide metadata and code generation hints to the Dart compiler or other tools. They start with the "@" symbol and can be used to customize behavior, perform validation, and generate code based on specific conditions.

94. **Explain Dart's "late" keyword and how it helps in handling non-nullable variables that are initialized later in the program's execution.**
   The "late" keyword is used with non-nullable variables that are guaranteed to be initialized later in the program's execution. It allows you to postpone the initialization of variables until they are needed, while still ensuring that they are not null when accessed.

95. **What are Dart's enumerations (enums), and how can you use them to represent a fixed set of constant values?**
   Dart enums are used to represent a fixed set of constant values, typically used to define a type with a restricted set of possible values. Enums provide a way to associate a name (identifier) with each constant value.

96. **Explain the concept of Dart's "call" method and how you can use it to make instances of a class callable like functions.**
   Dart allows you to override the "call" method in a class, enabling instances of that class to be called as if they were functions. This feature is useful when you want to treat objects as callable functions and provide a more natural API.

97. **What is Dart's "mixin" keyword, and how does it relate to mixins in Dart classes?**
   The "mixin" keyword in Dart is used to declare a mixin. A mixin is a way to reuse code in multiple class hierarchies without using inheritance. Mixins are applied using the "with" keyword when defining a class, allowing you to add behavior from one or more mixins to a class.

98. **Explain the concept of "type inference" in Dart and how it helps in determining variable types automatically during compilation.**
   Type inference in Dart is the ability of the Dart compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its initialization value. You don't need to explicitly specify the type of the variable; Dart infers it from the context and usage.

99. **What are Dart's "late final" and "late final" variables, and when should you use each?**
   "late final" and "late" are used to indicate that a variable is non-nullable and will be initialized later during the program's execution. "late" is used when the variable is initialized after the constructor is run, while "late final" is used when the variable is initialized within the constructor.

100. **Explain how you can handle errors and exceptions in Dart using try-catch blocks and the "on" and "catch" clauses.**
   In Dart, you can use try-catch blocks to handle errors and exceptions. The "on" clause is used to catch specific types of exceptions, while the "catch" clause without an argument is used to catch any type of exception. You can also use the "catch" clause

31. **What are Dart's "async" and "await" keywords, and how do they simplify asynchronous programming in Dart?**
   "async" is used to mark a function as asynchronous, allowing you to use "await" inside the function body to wait for asynchronous operations to complete. This makes asynchronous code more readable and straightforward.

32. **Explain the concept of Dart's "is" and "as" operators, and how they help with type checking and type casting.**
   The "is" operator is used for type checking, allowing you to verify if an object is of a specific type. The "as" operator is used for type casting, enabling you to safely convert an object to a specific type if it is of that type.

33. **What are Dart's "generics," and how can you use them to create reusable and type-safe data structures and functions?**
   Dart generics allow you to define classes and functions that can work with different types while ensuring type safety. By using generics, you can create data structures and algorithms that are reusable and adaptable to different data types.

34. **Explain the concept of Dart's "forEach," "map," "where," and "reduce" methods, and how they simplify working with collections.**
   "forEach" is used to apply a function to each element in a collection. "map" transforms each element in a collection according to a provided function. "where" filters elements based on a given condition. "reduce" combines elements into a single value using a combining function.

35. **What is Dart's "async*," and "yield" keywords used for, and how do they enable asynchronous stream generation?**
   "async*" is used to create asynchronous generators in Dart. Within an "async*" function, the "yield" keyword is used to emit values as an asynchronous stream. This allows you to generate a sequence of values over time without blocking the execution.

36. **Explain the concept of Dart's "Zone" and how it helps in managing asynchronous code and error handling across asynchronous boundaries.**
   "Zone" in Dart is used to manage the execution of asynchronous code and handle errors across asynchronous boundaries. It allows you to control error handling, propagate values, and create child zones to manage different aspects of asynchronous code.

37. **What are Dart's "extension methods," and how do they enable you to add functionality to existing classes without modifying their source code?**
   Dart extension methods allow you to add new functionality to existing classes without altering the original class's source code. You can define extension methods for third-party classes or built-in types, providing a convenient way to add utility functions.

38. **Explain Dart's "cascade notation (..)" and how it simplifies chaining multiple method calls on the same object.**
   Dart's cascade notation ("..") enables you to chain multiple method calls on the same object without repeating the object reference. It allows you to perform a sequence of operations on the same object in a concise and readable manner.

39. **What is Dart's "RegExp" class, and how can you use it to work with regular expressions for pattern matching and string manipulation?**
   Dart's "RegExp" class allows you to work with regular expressions for pattern matching and string manipulation. You can use "RegExp" methods like "allMatches" and "replaceFirst" to search, match, and manipulate strings based on patterns.

40. **Explain how you can handle concurrent operations and isolate communication using Dart's "Isolate" class for concurrent programming.**
   Dart's "Isolate" class allows you to run multiple concurrent tasks in separate memory isolates. You can communicate between isolates using "SendPort" and "ReceivePort," enabling concurrent processing and parallel execution of tasks.
